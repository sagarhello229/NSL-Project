# Nepali Sign Language Character Dataset

This project contains a dataset of Nepali sign language characters. The dataset is organized into two categories based on the background type: `Plain Background` and `Random Background`. Each category contains subfolders representing Nepali characters, with each folder containing a specific number of images.

## Folder Structure
The dataset is structured as follows:

```
├── Plain Background
│   ├── 0
│   ├── 1
│   ├── 2
│   ├── ...
│   └── 35
├── Random Background
│   ├── 0
│   ├── 1
│   ├── 2
│   ├── ...
│   └── 35
```

### Plain Background
- Contains 36 folders labeled from `0` to `35`, each representing a Nepali sign language character.
- Each folder has **1000 images** of the respective character captured against a plain background.

### Random Background
- Contains 36 folders labeled from `0` to `35`, each representing a Nepali sign language character.
- Each folder has **500 images** of the respective character captured against a random background.

## Folder to Nepali Character Mapping
Below is the mapping of folder numbers to Nepali characters:

| Folder Number | Nepali Character |

## Dataset Details
The dataset is designed to support machine learning and deep learning applications, particularly for tasks such as:
- Image classification
- Gesture recognition
- Sign language translation

### Nepali Characters Mapping
Each folder number corresponds to a specific Nepali character in sign language. A mapping table or reference for these numbers should be used in conjunction with this dataset for proper labeling and interpretation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the dataset.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the dataset folder and use the images as required for your project.

## Applications
This dataset can be utilized in:
- Training models to recognize Nepali sign language.
- Developing applications for aiding communication with the hearing-impaired community.
- Research in sign language recognition and interpretation.
